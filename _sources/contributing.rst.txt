Contributing
============

If you want to contribute to this project, please feel free to go ahead.

Some areas of contribution I'm looking for:

1. Solving the getJsResponse async problem as listed in :doc:`technical`.
2. Feature completeness. There are a lot of methods and signals that have not yet been 
   created. If you need to use any of them and are looking to add them, it is a fairly
   straightforward process, and all help would be appreciated. It might also be an 
   interesting project to autogenerate all the code... I have no idea how one could
   go about doing that, but I believe it might be possible
3. API documentation. Sphinx-apidoc doesn't seem to be able to do what I need. It treats all
   methods, attributes and pyqtSignals as equal. I would like to see if its possible
   to figure out an approach that is able to separate the signals and make a separate
   list of them.

Any other contributions, in terms of bug reports, feature requests and anything else are
appreciated as well.
